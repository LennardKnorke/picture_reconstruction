A picture reconstruction project

Given an input folder with multiple pictures and a target image, the programm will use k-nearest neighbor clustering to reconstruct the original pictures using pictures from the folder.
Works best with a great variety of filler pictures.

Warning: Messy code. This was my first project and I yet have to clean it up!
