An inconspicuous picture reconstruction project

Journal and Comments:

L 22.05: So. The PenisPy.py file is the original script I told you. It entails a function and executing it with a picture will recreate it based on its dark and bright pixel areas. I started a second attempt on it which I have not finished but can be found in colour reckognition in wich I expanded the colour range to 8. Next I'd try to do it again but with a similiarity based selection of the picture. not random out of a designated colour folder.
